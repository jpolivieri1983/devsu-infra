# Infrastructure creation for Devsu Practical Assessment

In this repo you can find:
- Cloudformation yaml file (main-devsu.yml) with resources definition, including the ECS cluster which will execute the docker image from the practical assessment.
- Workflow yaml file (.github/workflows/deploy-to-ecs.yml) to automatize the infrastructure creation using a GitHub Actions pipeline.
